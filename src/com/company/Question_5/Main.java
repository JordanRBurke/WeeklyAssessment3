        /* ANSWER QUESTION HERE:

        A abstract class hides some of the mechanics of the class, this helps when you need the basic things
        from that class but don't need everything that comes with it. It may be useful when doing userInteraction
        so they don't have to see the mechanics or the things they don't need to know.
